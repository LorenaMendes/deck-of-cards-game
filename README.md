# Deck of Cards Game

This project implements an interface (server and client) for the management of a simple game of cards. The backend implements an API that provides operations related to games, players, and decks, such as:
- create a game
- delete a game
- add a player to a game
- remove a player from a game
- add a deck to a game
- deal a cart to a player
- shuffle the game's deck
- and so on :)

The frontend implements a really basic interface that consumes this API and allows the user to make the operations and see its results.
